# Status

Read this at the start of every session, alongside AGENTS.md and docs/.
Update it before ending a session or when a block of work completes.

## Where we are

Working through `docs/build-plan.md`, one phase per session, in order.

**Phase A — Admin and configurability: built and verified. Stopping here
per the plan's own "one phase per session" rule.** Two items need your
decision before Phase B starts — see "Needs a decision" below.

## Phase checklist

- [x] **Phase A — Admin and configurability**
  - [x] Drug list: add/edit/remove (name, type, strength options, price, low-stock threshold, expiry date)
  - [x] Procedure list: add/edit/remove (name, default price)
  - [x] Prescription templates: view/rename/delete (doctor still creates them)
  - [x] Custom patient fields: definitions table + JSONB values; confirmed live that a new field appears on the intake form with zero code change
  - [x] Logins: add (Edge Function, service role) / remove (plain RLS-permitted delete); assign roles
  - [x] Duplicate patient merge (blocked if either has an open visit today; keeps the older id; reassigns visits + patient_comments)
  - [x] Checkpoint: `docs/security-review.md` — run, findings below, **not fixed yet** (review's own rule: report, don't fix in the same pass)
  - [x] Checkpoint: ponytail — caught a real gap before calling this done (see "Caught by ponytail" below)
- [ ] Phase B — Stock
- [ ] Phase C — Payments completed (UPI, pay-later/credit, unpaid list, settling)
- [ ] Phase D — Documents, register, reps
- [ ] Phase E — Reports
- [ ] Phase F — Offline
- [ ] Phase G — Go live (item 7, the health endpoint, is already done — see below)

## Needs a decision before Phase B

1. **`admin_search_patients_for_merge` gives admin a narrow read of
   `patients.name/age/phone/created_at`.** `docs/security-review.md`
   states unconditionally: "admin cannot read patients, visits, bills,
   prescriptions, or patient_comments." Merge (a Phase A requirement)
   can't identify duplicate records without *some* way to look patients
   up. Built as narrow as it can be: a SECURITY DEFINER RPC returning
   only those four fields, admin-gated inside the function, not a
   relaxation of `patients_select`'s RLS. Confirmed empirically (
   `admin-phase-test.mjs`) that admin still gets nothing from `visits`,
   `bills`, `prescriptions`, or `patient_comments` — this is the one
   exception, not a general opening. Decide: is this an acceptable,
   narrowly-scoped exception, or should merge candidates be identified a
   different way (e.g. reception looks them up, admin only confirms by
   id)?
2. **One orphaned test login exists on staging**:
   `should-not-exist-<timestamp>@staging.test`, currently holding role
   `doctor` at Clinic A, visible in the real Logins tab. Left over from
   this phase's own Edge Function testing (a test assumption was wrong —
   see the git history for `admin-create-login-test.mjs` — the call
   that created it was legitimate at the time, not a security hole: it
   required a genuine admin-role session to succeed). Harmless
   (staging-only synthetic data) but should be removed — either via the
   Logins tab's own "Remove" (revokes the role; the login itself would
   need `auth.admin.deleteUser`, which no script in this repo has
   access to) or manually in the Supabase dashboard.

## Caught by ponytail (fixed before calling Phase A done)

Custom patient fields and the "procedure immediately usable" half of
Phase A's own "done when" line were **not** originally wired end to end
— the backend/RLS/Admin-UI side was built and tested, but nothing made a
new field actually render on the intake form. Caught during the ponytail
pass, not by a user report. Fixed: `NewPatientForm.tsx` now queries
`patient_field_definitions` and renders one input per definition
(text/number/date/boolean), coerced to the right JSON type before being
written into `patients.custom_fields`. Verified live end to end: added a
field in Admin, it appeared on the intake form with no further code
change, and the value round-tripped into the database correctly.

## Done already (predates the lettered plan)

- The money loop: check-in, search, live queue, doctor's consultation
  screen, carried-forward comments, prescription writing (templates/
  repeat-last/search), procedures, doctor-set final amount + derived
  discount, cash billing, browser print (prescription + receipt, zero
  connectivity).
- Tenant/role isolation (`isolation-test.mjs`, 19/19).
- Billing/pricing arithmetic correctness (`billing-test.mjs` 16/16,
  `pricing-test.mjs` 15/15).
- A structural frontend redesign: dense sortable worklist + Drawer
  overlay, replacing the two-pane grid every earlier visual pass kept.
- Realtime was silently non-functional (the `supabase_realtime`
  publication had never included any table) — fixed; both directions
  now sync in under a second.
- A real correctness bug: confirming a prescription used to move a
  visit straight to `packing` on its own, locking a doctor out of
  pricing with no way back for anyone — fixed, plus a database backstop.
- Polling backstop: `refetchInterval` is 30s globally
  (`refetchOnWindowFocus: true` on top).
- Keep-alive health endpoint (`supabase/functions/health`) — public,
  does a real read against `clinics` via the service role, verified live
  via `pg_stat_user_tables` that it's a genuine query.

## Context a future session needs

- **Migrations are immutable once applied.** Never edit an applied
  migration file — write a new one, even for a one-line fix.
- **Supabase MCP is read-only verification, never a way to change
  staging.** Every schema/data change is a migration file, applied via
  `supabase db push`, committed.
- **The two-Supabase-privilege-grant gotcha keeps recurring** — this
  phase alone hit it once more (`merge_patients` had EXECUTE granted to
  `anon` despite `revoke ... from public`) and caught it proactively via
  `information_schema.routine_privileges` before it shipped. Check this
  for every new `SECURITY DEFINER` function, every phase, no exceptions.
- **A user can legitimately hold more than one role at a clinic** —
  the doctor holds `{doctor, admin}` alongside a dedicated admin-only
  account (confirmed live: `doctor.a` and `admin.only` both hold
  `admin` for Clinic A). Any query assuming "at most one admin row per
  clinic" (e.g. `.maybeSingle()` without `.limit(1)`) will break the
  moment it runs as a caller who satisfies both. Hit this once already
  in `admin-create-login`'s own admin-check query — fixed with
  `.limit(1)` before `.maybeSingle()`.
- **`auth.users` is not reachable from a plain client query** — it's
  outside the `public` schema PostgREST exposes. Any UI needing an
  email (not just a `user_id`) needs a SECURITY DEFINER RPC
  (`list_clinic_logins` is the precedent) or an Edge Function.
- **Creating a login needs the service role** (`auth.admin.createUser`)
  — `supabase/functions/admin-create-login` is the pattern: bind a
  caller-JWT client to check authorization first, then switch to a
  service-role client to perform the actual privileged write. Rolls
  back the orphaned auth account if the follow-up `user_roles` insert
  fails.
- **Removing a login's role does NOT delete the underlying `auth.users`
  row** — deliberate: revoking clinic access is not erasing an identity
  that may hold a role at a second clinic once one exists. There is
  currently no in-app way to hard-delete a login entirely; the one
  stray test account from this phase (see above) needs the dashboard.
- **Every FK from `bill_line_items`/`prescription_items`/
  `visit_procedures`/`prescription_template_items` into
  `medicines`/`procedures`/`prescription_templates` is `NO ACTION`**
  (confirmed via `information_schema.referential_constraints` before
  writing Phase A's migration) — a real "remove" on a drug/procedure
  that's ever been used will fail at the database level. The Admin UI
  catches this and shows a plain message rather than crashing; there is
  no soft-delete/archive flag, by design (not asked for).
  `prescription_template_items.template_id` was changed to `ON DELETE
  CASCADE` specifically (its own migration), since a template's items
  have no independent historical meaning once the template is gone —
  medicines/procedures were deliberately left `NO ACTION`.
- **Merge only ever needed to reassign two tables** — `visits` and
  `patient_comments` are the only tables with a `patient_id` FK
  (checked directly via `information_schema.columns`, not assumed).
  `visit_pricing`/`bills` key off `visit_id` and follow automatically.
  If a future phase adds a new table with `patient_id`, `merge_patients`
  needs updating in a new migration — it will not pick it up on its own.
- The synthetic seed data (staging only, never production) now includes
  a scattering of Phase-A test fixtures (drugs, procedures, templates,
  custom field definitions, patients) with obvious names
  (`UI Test Drug ...`, `Admin Test Med ...`, `Merge Test ...`) — harmless,
  consistent with everything else already in staging from earlier
  phases.

## Next action

Read this file, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/design.md`, `docs/architecture-spec.md`,
and the PRD, resolve the two decisions above if you can, then start
Phase B (Stock) — tests first, per its own instruction in
`docs/build-plan.md`.
